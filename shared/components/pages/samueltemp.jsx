                    <h3>Remedy Entertainment</h3>
                    <p>In late 2017 I joined Remedy as an external developer. A totally new experience for me to be doing game development.</p>
                    <p>Why would a web developer be working on games? The technology for creating UI's for games has come a long way and Remedy took on a new middleware called Coherent GT, which meant the UI would be written in HTML.</p>
                    <p>The stack we worked on was Coherent's own tech, some C++, some good old HTML and CSS. And then some React to make the JS a bit more manageble.</p> 
                    <p>The product will be launched in 2018.</p>

                    <h3>Elisa</h3>
                    <p>I had some previous experience working at Elisa, one of Finland's largest ISP's. When Peik from Reaktor called me if I would be interested in joining their joint team doing Growth Hacking for B2B clients I did not hesitate.</p>
                    <p>We started out improving the ecommerce tracking, namely with the Enhanced Ecommerce plugin for Google Analytics (GA) and Google Tag Manager (GTM).</p>

                    <p>The first few AB-test were done with <a href="http://frosmo.com" className="mo_linkicon__link" target="_blank">Frosmo</a>. But we soon noticed the Single-page App made with Angular, was not playing very nicely. We then switched to using a custom JS tag in GTM for all our AB-tests.</p>
                    
                    <p>Here's some screenshots of the UI-elements we created for our AB-tests.</p>
